"""Token-usage accounting for Anna's batch judge.

Mirrors Beatrice's cost model so every pipeline stage reports cost the same way:
per-1M-token list rates, the Message Batches API's 50% discount, and the 10%
rate on cache-read input tokens. The rate table is duplicated rather than shared
because each stage is a standalone package; if a rate is corrected here it should
be corrected in Beatrice's ``pipeline/batch_match.py`` and Susan's ``cost.py`` too.
