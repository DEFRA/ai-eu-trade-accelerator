Mary — static search filters: the TWO dials that decide the entire corpus.

This is the whole of Mary's "smart filtering" — and it is deliberately not very
smart. There is NO query string, NO relevance ranking, NO date or popularity
gate. The GOV.UK Search API is simply asked for every page that:

    belongs to one of these ORGANISATIONS   AND   is one of these DOCUMENT_TYPES

…and then every matching page is fetched in full (stage 2). The intelligent,
topic-aware narrowing happens downstream in Radia, not here.

So these two lists are the only levers on what exists at all:

    widen  -> bigger corpus, longer body fetch, higher recall ceiling
    narrow -> smaller corpus, faster, lower recall ceiling

They are imported by ``get_defra_guidance_pages.py`` (stage 1).
