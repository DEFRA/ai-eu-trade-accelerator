Mary — operational configuration: every tuning static, named in one place.

`filters.py` holds *what* we pull (scope — the organisations and document types).
This file holds *how* we pull it (endpoints, page size, rate limits, paths). No
magic numbers should appear in the stage scripts; they all live here with a name.
