# Method

Judit analyzes structured legal propositions, not just document text.

The workflow is:

1. build a source register
2. extract propositions
3. enrich proposition inventory (categories, tags, cross-reference structure, review state; opaque `id`, source-derived `proposition_key`, and display labels per ADR-0018)
4. optionally compare propositions across jurisdictions for divergence
5. export structured and narrative outputs
