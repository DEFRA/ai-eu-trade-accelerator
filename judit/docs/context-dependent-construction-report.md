# Context-dependent construction report

**Date:** 2026-06-12
**Corpus:** Slurry GB principal-5 (regenerated export)
**Export:** `/Users/bram/Code/defra/ai-eu-trade-accelerator/judit/runs/slurry-gb-principal-5-current-export`

Deterministic comparison of **effective-law statement text**, **core proposition text**, and **required_context** propositions/fragments for `context_dependent` and trace-blocked statements (no LLM).

## Executive summary

- **413** / 1415 statements are `context_dependent`.
- **179** (43.3%) are already **trace-reviewable**; **234** (56.7%) are **trace-blocked**.
- **168** (40.7%) have a **material incorporation gap** — required context is not already present in statement/core text.
- **0** trace-blocked statements (0.0% of blocked) are **structural incorporation candidates** — material resolved context absent from statement text, blocked only by monolithic/unsurfaced-context trace gates.
- **0** pass strict post-inline trace simulation (0.0% of blocked); naive text append alone does not realign composition fragments.
- **413** statements are verbatim (or near-verbatim) copies of the core proposition — effective-law generation is not composing additional wording today.
- **Recommendation:** **inline context selectively** for resolved material context with incorporation gaps; **keep external** for confirm/noise-only dependencies; **defer to reviewer** when context remains unresolved; **emit multiple statements** when several independent substantive context propositions apply.

## 1. Methodology

### Population

- All `effective_law_statements` with `standalone_status = context_dependent`.
- **Trace-blocked** subset: context-dependent statements failing composition-trace reviewability gates (same deterministic logic as Prompt 83 composition trace report).

### Per-statement comparison

For each statement:

1. **Core proposition** — `source_proposition_ids[0]` → `propositions.json` text and `legal_effect_type`.
2. **Effective statement** — `statement_text` (today identical to core proposition text in almost all cases).
3. **Required context** — each `required_context` entry: `kind`, `locator`, `resolution_status`, linked proposition text, fragment excerpt.

### Context role classification (deterministic, per entry)

| Role | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| a) confirm | Context proposition text already contained in statement or core text; or unresolved locator already cited in statement |
| b) constrain | `host_rule` / `incorporated_rule` / `incorporated_factors`; or condition markers in context absent from core |
| c) exception | `legal_effect_type = derogation` or exception/unless markers in context text |
| d) definition | `legal_effect_type = definition`, `proposition_tier = definitional_rule`, or `kind = supporting_definition` |
| e) alter effect | Resolved context with different substantive `legal_effect_type` from core |
| f) noise | Unresolved context with no linked propositions and no material locator signal |

Statement-level primary role = most severe entry role (alter > exception > definition > constrain > confirm > noise).

### Incorporation gap

A statement has an incorporation gap when any context entry has a **material role** (b–e) and its proposition text is **not** already contained in the statement or core text.

### Simulated inlining (reviewability estimate)

Hypothetical `statement_text` = core text + unresolved material context proposition texts (deduplicated). Re-run composition-trace reviewability gates. Count statements that are trace-blocked today but trace-reviewable after simulation.

## 2. Population breakdown

| Metric | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Context-dependent statements | 413 |
| Trace-reviewable | 179 |
| Trace-blocked | 234 |
| Statement text matches core proposition | 413 |
| No resolved context propositions | 8 |
| Material incorporation gap | 168 |
| Incorporation candidates (gap + resolved context) | 168 |
| — already trace-reviewable | 168 |
| — trace-blocked | 0 |
| Structural reviewability gain if inlined (blocked only) | 0 |
| Strict post-inline trace pass (blocked only) | 0 |

### Context entry roles (non-exclusive across entries)

| Role | Entries |
| --- | ---: |
| a) merely confirm | 25 |
| b) materially constrain | 132 |
| c) introduce exceptions | 21 |
| d) introduce definitions | 45 |
| e) alter legal effect | 19 |
| f) irrelevant noise | 5 |

### Statement primary context role

| Role | Statements |
| --- | ---: |
| a) merely confirm | 17 |
| b) materially constrain | 94 |
| c) introduce exceptions | 21 |
| d) introduce definitions | 35 |
| e) alter legal effect | 19 |
| f) irrelevant noise | 227 |

### Incorporation recommendations

| Recommendation | Statements |
| --- | ---: |
| keep context external | 243 |
| inline context selectively | 138 |
| emit multiple statements | 30 |
| defer to reviewer | 2 |

## 3. Findings

1. **Effective-law statements do not incorporate context into wording.** 413 / 413 statements match the core proposition text exactly; export transform copies `proposition_text` verbatim and leaves `required_context` external.
2. **Most context dependence is locator citation, not missing inline text.** 25 context entries are classified as confirmatory (locator cited in statement or context text already present).
3. **Material gaps with resolved context are already trace-reviewable.** 168 / 168 incorporation candidates pass trace gates today without inlining; 0 blocked candidates remain. Trace-blocked context-dependence is primarily **unresolved locators**, not missing inline wording.
4. **Unresolved context dominates trace-blocked cases.** 8 context-dependent statements have zero resolved `required_context.proposition_ids` — inlining cannot help until locator resolution improves.
5. **Selective inlining is sufficient; full composition is not.** 30 statements warrant multiple emitted statements; 2 should defer to reviewer while locators remain unresolved.

## 5. Recommendations for effective-law generation

| Strategy | When | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Keep context external** | 243 statements | Confirmatory or noise-only context; statement already cites locators or text is present |
| **Inline context selectively** | 138 statements | Resolved material context (constrain/exception/definition) not yet in statement text |
| **Emit multiple statements** | 30 statements | Multiple independent substantive context propositions — single sentence would over-compose |
| **Defer to reviewer** | 2 statements | Unresolved locators; inlining would fabricate law |

### Proposed pipeline behaviour

1. **Default:** Keep `statement_text` as core proposition text; attach `required_context` metadata (current behaviour).
2. **When resolved + material gap:** Append or clause-merge resolved context proposition text into `statement_text`; mark `standalone_status` → `standalone` or `partially_resolved` depending on remaining unresolved entries.
3. **When multiple substantive contexts:** Emit sibling statements sharing provenance rather than one compound sentence.
4. **When unresolved:** Retain `context_dependent`; surface locators in review UI; do not inline.
5. **Do not use LLM composition** — all incorporation decisions are deterministic from proposition text, `legal_effect_type`, `required_context.kind`, and resolution status.
