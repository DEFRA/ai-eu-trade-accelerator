# Judit

Judit is a source-first, proposition-first legal analysis workbench.
It supports single-jurisdiction proposition inventory as a first-class workflow and
builds divergence comparison on top of that substrate.

Generated outputs are committed alongside their sources. Run `just docs-refresh` to regenerate everything from sources.

## v1 focus

- source register
- source registry and registry-driven runs
- proposition inventory and review workflow
- divergence workflow built on propositions
- operational UI and analysis UI split
- operations/audit surface with temporal history inspection
- local/cloud model routing through LiteLLM
- export bundle for future static rendering
- polished docs, diagrams, and demo assets
