# ADR-0019: Model usage strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Judit processes legal texts into structured propositions. Many systems rely heavily on language models, which reduces auditability and trust.

## Decision

Judit adopts a deterministic-first pipeline with controlled model usage.

- Source intake, categorisation, and completeness are deterministic
- Proposition extraction may use a local model
- Divergence reasoning may optionally use a frontier model
- Narrative output is template-based

## Consequences

- Improved auditability
- Reproducible outputs
- Clear separation between deterministic and model-assisted logic
- Easier governance and review
