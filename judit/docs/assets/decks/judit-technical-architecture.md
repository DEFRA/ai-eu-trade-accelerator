# Judit — Technical architecture

Architecture deck for engineers and integrators.

Source-of-truth: `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`, `docs/architecture/pipeline-overview.md`, `docs/reference/artifacts.md`, ADRs under `docs/decisions/`.

## Architecture at a glance

![width:1100](../generated/diagrams/technical-architecture.svg)

*Figure: Runtime structure across analysis workbench, operations/registry surface, FastAPI API, source registry, pipeline runner, caches, LiteLLM, and run artifacts/traces/export bundle.*

## Layers

1. **Pipeline and storage** — ingest sources, run staged processing, persist inventories, artefacts, traces, and quality summaries under `dist/static-report/`.
2. **LLM gateway** — LiteLLM/OpenAI-compatible endpoint routes controlled model calls for the small set of assisted stages under policy (see ADR-0019).
3. **Analysis and operations surfaces** — read-mostly workbench (`/`) and operations/registry inspector (`/ops`); selected controlled mutation paths for registry, review decisions, async run jobs, repair, and dev reset.
4. **Docs and export assets** — published narratives and bundles built from validated structured outputs.

## Pipeline (v2)

![width:1100](../generated/diagrams/pipeline-overview-v2.svg)

*Figure: End-to-end pipeline from source registry and snapshots through fragment selection and extraction, quality/lint gating, export, ops UI inspection, human review promotion, and optional downstream divergence.*

## Fragment selection modes

![width:1100](../generated/diagrams/fragment-selection-modes.svg)

`required_only`, `required_plus_focus`, `all_matching` — selection controls cost, noise, and reviewability. Selection/skip audit fields are written to `proposition_extraction_jobs.json` for every run.

## Extraction repair flow

![width:1000](../generated/diagrams/extraction-repair-flow.svg)

Outcomes: clean, fallback-derived, repairable, fail-closed. Definition fallback handles definition-heavy clauses when model JSON parsing fails. `repairable != accepted`. See `docs/dev/extraction-repair.md`.

## Run artifacts

![width:1100](../generated/diagrams/artifact-map.svg)

Stability labels are literal: `stable/operator-facing`, `evolving`, `internal`, `domain/profile-specific`, `compatibility`. See `docs/reference/artifacts.md` for the full table.

## Proposition identity (ADR-0018)

- `Proposition.id` is opaque, stable machine identity.
- `proposition_key` carries source lineage: `<instrument-id>:<fragment-locator>:pNNN` when derived from registered sources.
- `label` / `short_name` are human-readable; `slug` is for routing only and not durable identity.

## Model usage strategy (ADR-0019)

- Deterministic-first pipeline; models only in explicitly defined stages.
- `heuristic` (deterministic / no model), `local`, `frontier` extraction modes.
- Traces persist in run artifacts: `proposition_extraction_traces.json`, `proposition_extraction_jobs.json`, `extraction_llm_call_traces.json`.
- `extraction_fallback`: `fallback` / `mark_needs_review` / `fail_closed`.
- `model_error_policy`: `continue_with_fallback` / `continue_repairable` / `stop_repairable`.

## Temporal audit

![width:1000](../generated/diagrams/temporal-audit.svg)

Temporal lineage links source snapshots, proposition revisions, divergence records, and review decisions back to source fragments. APIs:

- `/ops/sources/{source_id}/history`, `/timeline`, `/snapshots`
- `/ops/propositions/{proposition_key}/history`
- `/ops/divergence-findings/{finding_id}/history`

## Review governance

![width:900](../generated/diagrams/proposition-review-workflow.svg)

- Append-only `pipeline_review_decisions.json`: `approved`, `rejected`, `needs_review`, `overridden`, `deferred`.
- Decision rows target `artifact_type` + `artifact_id` and may carry `applies_to_field` and `supersedes_decision_id`.
- `guidance-ready` is a promotion state, not default output.

## Operational/runtime truth

- Run artifacts persist under `dist/static-report/runs/<run-id>/`.
- Source registry state persisted separately, inspectable/refreshable via API.
- Async jobs: `runs/_jobs/<job>/job.json` + `events.json` for status and progress timeline.
- Read paths via `/ops/*`; write paths only on documented mutation endpoints.

## Boundaries kept stable

- Export bundle remains the renderer-facing boundary so future static renderers consume validated output without owning business logic.
- Stable vs evolving vs domain-specific artifact contracts are literal — pin behavior accordingly.

## ADRs to read

- ADR-0005 — Source-first ingestion
- ADR-0006 — Proposition-level comparison unit
- ADR-0007 — Export bundle / renderer boundary
- ADR-0010 — Human review in core workflow
- ADR-0013 — Traceable pipeline run artifacts
- ADR-0014 — Proposition-first architecture
- ADR-0017 — Operational history API surface
- ADR-0018 — Proposition identity and naming
- ADR-0019 — Model usage strategy
