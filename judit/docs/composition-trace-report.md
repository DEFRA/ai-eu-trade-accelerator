# Composition trace report

**Date:** 2026-06-12
**Corpus:** Slurry GB principal-5 (regenerated export)
**Export:** `/Users/bram/Code/defra/ai-eu-trade-accelerator/judit/runs/slurry-gb-principal-5-current-export`

Prototypes first-class **composition traces** for statements currently flagged **composition opacity**, using deterministic reconstruction from statement recipes and proposition links (no LLM).

## Executive summary

- **732** / 1415 statements carry composition opacity triggers (same class as Prompt 82 reviewability blockers).
- **480** (65.6%) become **trace-reviewable** when decomposed into ordered composition traces with role labels and provenance.
- **252** (34.4%) remain opaque: traces exist but fail reviewability gates (unknown coverage, missing context surfacing, or incomplete provenance).
- **Verdict:** Explicit composition traces eliminate composition opacity for **65.6%** of opaque statements; the remainder need better text-span alignment or context fragments, not just export packaging.

## 1. Methodology

### Opacity population

A statement is **composition-opaque** when any of:

- `high_composition` — 3+ unique linked propositions
- `standalone_status` is `context_dependent` or `partially_resolved`
- 3+ `required_context` entries
- non-empty `connector_context`

### Trace construction (deterministic)

1. `buildStatementRecipe()` — one row per proposition ref (source, supporting, required context, connector/via)
2. `buildStatementCompositionSegments()` — ordered text spans aligned to statement text
3. Role classification per fragment from ref role + `legal_effect_type` / `proposition_tier` / `presentation_role`

### Trace-reviewability gates

A trace **resolves opacity** when all hold:

- Not a single `unknown` span covering the statement
- **Structural decomposition** for multi-proposition / context-dependent statements: ≥2 non-unknown fragments, or one fragment with ≥2 proposition IDs and a `required_context` role
- **Context surfacing** for `context_dependent` / `partially_resolved` with linked context: at least one `required_context` trace fragment
- Unknown text coverage ≤ 15%
- ≥ 90% of linked propositions appear in trace fragments
- Every `required_context` proposition appears in a `required_context` trace fragment
- Every non-unknown fragment has proposition linkage and source excerpt

## 4. Findings

1. **Traces are buildable today** from existing export fields — no LLM required. Current export has no `statement_recipe` or `composition_trace`; workbench derives recipes from proposition links.
2. **65.6% resolvable** — explicit traces clear composition opacity only where structural decomposition and context surfacing already succeed; monolithic single-fragment traces do not count.
3. **Dominant residual blocker:** `monolithic_composition` (252 statements) — most opaque statements collapse to one source-proposition span; context and supporting propositions are linked in metadata but not text-positioned.
4. **High-composition statements** with multiple proposition refs in one aligned span can pass when `required_context` role is assigned — but `context_dependent` statements without `required_context` fragments remain monolithic.
5. **Exporting traces is necessary but not sufficient** — pipeline must also emit `statement_fragments` with text-aligned spans per proposition, or opacity persists despite trace metadata.

## 5. Proposed export extension

### Schema

Add optional `composition_trace` to each `effective_law_statements` entry:

```json
{
  "composition_trace": [
    {
      "order": 0,
      "text": "fragment text as it appears in statement_text",
      "start": 0,
      "end": 42,
      "role": "core_proposition",
      "proposition_ids": [
        "prop-abc"
      ],
      "context_locators": [],
      "source_locator": "SI 2010/2211, reg 4(1)",
      "source_excerpt": "verbatim excerpt from source fragment",
      "support_status": "supported"
    }
  ]
}
```

**`role` enum:** `core_proposition` | `supporting_proposition` | `definition` | `exception` | `required_context` | `connector_inference` | `unknown`

**Invariants:**

- Fragments are ordered; `start`/`end` are half-open offsets into `statement_text`
- `text` must equal `statement_text.slice(start, end)`
- `proposition_ids` must be subset of statement's linked propositions
- `required_context` fragments must include `context_locators` from `required_context`

### Migration strategy

1. **Phase 0 (now):** Workbench computes traces client-side via `buildCompositionTrace()` — no export change.
2. **Phase 1:** Pipeline emits `composition_trace` on export using the same deterministic functions (shared TS module or Python port).
3. **Phase 2:** Backfill existing runs on read; `statement_recipe` remains the per-proposition row view, `composition_trace` is the ordered text-span view.
4. **Phase 3:** Use trace quality gates in `run_quality_summary` — count `trace_reviewable` vs `composition_opaque` per run.

### Workbench rendering implications

- **Statement review panel:** Render `composition_trace` as the primary highlighted text (replacing derived `buildStatementCompositionSegments` when export field present).
- **Role colours:** Map roles to existing segment surface classes — core/supporting → composition source; required_context → assessment context; unknown → dashed inferred.
- **Inspector stack:** Click fragment → scroll proposition stack filtered to `proposition_ids`; show `source_excerpt` inline.
- **Queue filters:** Add "trace-blocked" preset for statements where `composition_trace` exists but fails reviewability gates.
- **No regression:** When `composition_trace` absent, keep current derived path (`buildStatementRecipe` + `buildStatementCompositionSegments`).
