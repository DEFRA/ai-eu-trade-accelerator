"""Token-cost accounting for Radia's two batch passes.

Pass 1 (Haiku) and pass 2 (Sonnet) bill at different rates, and both run on the
Message Batches API (0.5x) — except an oversized-page rescue, which uses the
immediate Messages API at full price. ``cost_usd`` prices one token bucket; the
CLI sums the buckets.

If a model isn't in ``RATES`` (e.g. an overridden ``--model``) the price is
``None`` rather than a guess: the tokens are still recorded, but an invented
dollar figure would be worse than an honest gap.
